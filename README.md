# Google Gemini AI Chatbot with Node.js

## Description
Google-Gemini-AI Chatbot is a Node.js application demonstrating the integration of Google's cutting-edge Gemini API to create an AI-powered conversational experience. Leveraging Vertex AI's capabilities, this chatbot offers natural language processing and generation for engaging interactions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled.

### Project Setup:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/srikavya26/Google-Gemini-AI-.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Google-Gemini-AI-`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

### Configuration:
- Create a file named `.env` (not included in Git for security reasons) and add the following environment variables:
    - `GEMINI_ENDPOINT`: The URL of your Gemini endpoint (obtain from Vertex AI).
    - `GEMINI_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
    - (Optional) `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key (if required for authentication).

### Run the Chatbot:
- Start the chatbot server: `node app.js`

## Using the Gemini API
This project utilizes Google's Vertex AI platform and its Gemini API, which provides access to powerful generative AI models. Here's a basic overview of how it works:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft prompts to guide the model in generating desired responses, considering conversation context.
2. **API Request**: Utilize Node.js libraries like axios to send HTTP requests to the Gemini API endpoint, including prompts and configuration options.
3. **Response Processing**: Parse JSON response from the API, containing generated text for chatbot responses.
4. **Iteration**: Continuously loop through prompts and responses to maintain conversation flow.

## Code Structure
- `app.js`: Main application file, responsible for user input handling, interaction with Gemini API, and response generation.
- (Optional) Additional helper files or modules for specific functionalities.

## Customization
This project offers a foundation for building customized AI chatbots by:
- Modifying prompts to tailor responses to specific domains or use cases.
- Integrating with external APIs or services for enhanced capabilities.
- Implementing user authentication and session management for personalized experiences.

## Further Exploration
- Refer to official Gemini API documentation for detailed instructions and advanced features: [Gemini API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/gemini)
